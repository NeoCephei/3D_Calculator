# Container Capacity Calculator

## Description 
This is a personal project I created while working on logistics for a company where I had to reorganize the warehouse.
So in order to maximize the container usages I created this basic calculator that tells you how many items can you fit into a container.

## How does it works?
As a simple js/css/html app you just need to doble click the index.html file and everything will follow.
Type the measures of one single item.
Type the measures of the inner space of your container.

The code will calculate the max amount of items that could fit based on the 6 possible orientations and display a small image to know which orientation is the best.

## Future Plans
* Resize of output images relative to inputs
* Apply React framework and deploy for online usage
* Improve styles and logic
* Combinational calculation to maximize efficiency
