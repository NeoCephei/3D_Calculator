# 3D Calculator
 
 This was intended to be a personal projects code, but I ended up using it for a work project where I should calculate the capacity of given spaces for random sized items.
 Is not the best as it doesnt care about combinatory aligment, in any case what it does is to calculate the volume of the object, then the volume of the box, divide to know the max theoric capacity and then calculates the capacity for the 6 differents arrangements of the item.
 
 My main challenge here was to be able to draw the cubes and I just "StackOverflow it"...
 Whatever if its useful for anyone just enjoy it and feel free to improve it for your needs.
